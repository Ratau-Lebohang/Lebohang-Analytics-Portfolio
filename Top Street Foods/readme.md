##  Description 
For this personal project, I dove into a raw dataset of street food vendors from around the globe.   I started by cleaning and transforming the data in Excel, then used BigQuery to write SQL codes that helped uncover interesting patterns and trends.   Finally, I brought the data to life by creating interactive dashboards in Tableau.   This project was all about testing my skills and boosting my CV with hands-on experience.
