##  Key Business Questions 
- How do shopping habits differ by age and gender?
- When do sales peak or decline (days, months, seasons)?
- What are the most popular product categories?
- Does age impact spending behavior and product preferences?
- Do holiday periods influence customer behavior?
  
--- 

##  Key Insights 
- Middle-aged customers tend to spend more per transaction, especially in specific product categories.
- Women and men show clear differences in product preferences.
- Holiday seasons significantly influence both basket size and product selection.
- Bulk buyers demonstrate higher average spend but favor specific product categories.
- Certain product categories exhibit wider price ranges, suggesting opportunities for pricing optimization.

##  Strategic Recommendations 
- Develop targeted promotions based on customer age and gender preferences to drive deeper engagement and higher conversion rates.
- Create exclusive incentives for bulk buyers, such as personalized bundles or loyalty reward tiers, to increase customer lifetime value. - Review and optimize pricing strategies for categories with high price variance to maximize profitability.
