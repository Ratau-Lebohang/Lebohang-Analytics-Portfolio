## Overview

This project explores **employee attrition patterns** using an HR dataset sourced from Kaggle.  
The analysis uncovers key factors driving employee turnover, including job roles, compensation, tenure, performance ratings, and satisfaction levels.

The objective is to deliver actionable insights that organizations can use to:

- Identify high-risk employee groups
- Enhance retention strategies
- Strengthen workforce planning

This project highlights my ability to connect **data analysis** to **strategic HR decision-making**, showcasing **technical proficiency**, **business acumen**, and a focus on **actionable outcomes**.

##  Key Business Questions Addressed

1. What is the overall attrition rate, and how does it vary across departments and job roles?
2. How does monthly income influence attrition rates?
3. What is the average tenure of employees who leave, and when does attrition typically peak?
4. Which employee segments (by age, role, department, gender) are at the highest risk of leaving?
5. Can we predict attrition by analyzing satisfaction, tenure, compensation, and demographics?
6. What strategic interventions can reduce attrition and boost employee retention?

##  Key Insights

- The overall employee attrition rate stands at **16%**, with higher turnover among **Sales Executives** and **Research & Development** roles.
- **Low-income employees**, particularly **Research Scientists**, exhibited a **20% attrition rate**, highlighting a strong link between salary and turnover.
- Out of **1,472 employees**, **237 resigned** or were lost to attrition during the study period.
- **Employees aged 40–50**, predominantly **males** in **Sales Executive** roles within the **Research & Development** department, are most at risk.
