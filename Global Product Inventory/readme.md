##  Key Business Questions 
- Which products are at risk of stock depletion soon?
- What’s the average shelf life per product category?
- How many products are set to expire within the next 6–12 months?
- Are highly rated products sufficiently stocked?
- Which product categories have the highest and lowest average ratings?
- What are the most common product tags, and how do they correlate with price and stock levels?
- What’s the average customer rating per product category? 

--- 


##  Key Insights 
- Several high-demand products show critically low stock levels with fewer than 10 units remaining.
- A significant portion of the inventory is set to expire within the next 6–12 months.
- Highly rated products (ratings of 4 and above) exhibit mixed stock levels some are understocked, risking lost revenue opportunities.

##  Recommendations 
- Implement **dynamic discounting** for products nearing expiration (6–9 months) to minimize write-offs and reduce losses.
- **Control pricing inconsistencies** in categories affected by variations (e.g., color, size) to ensure fair pricing while protecting margins.
- Investigate **product quality issues** in lower-rated categories and roll out targeted customer feedback surveys, bundled discount offers, or loyalty incentives to improve satisfaction and drive sales.
